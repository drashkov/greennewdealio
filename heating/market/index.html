<h1 id="market-opportunity">Market Opportunity</h1>
<p>In my <a href="../robot-mole/">Robot Mole</a> article, I discussed a way to tackle the problem of carbon emissions from heating houses and presented that a sufficiently advanced robot tunneling machine could do it. But would this really make a dent in our emissions? Is there a real opportunity here, something worth investing in? </p>
<h2 id="number-of-dwellings-in-north-america">Number of Dwellings in North America</h2>
<p>First, let's consider the amount and type of dwellings there are in North America. We'll only consider houses and smaller apartment buildings, as larger apartment buildings and condos will need a different, scaled up version of this technology. According to <a href="https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/housing-statistics">US Census data</a>, there are about 76 million single unit buildings in the US and another 10 million buildings with 2-4 units. According to <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/98-200-x/2016005/98-200-x2016005-eng.cfm">Statistics Canada</a>, the numbers are similar per-capita, with 70% of the roughly 14m private dwellings being 1-4 units. This is roughly 10 million dwellings, with the vast majority of those single detached houses.</p>
<p>Of course, whether a geothermal system is required depends highly on the climate and in particular the minimum temperature you're likely to encouter. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19122">This study</a> has a number of good breakdowns about the type of emissions from residential dwellings in the US and their variation across the country. For our estimates, we'll take the population of New England, the Great Lakes region and parts of the Mid-West and Rockes as being cold enough to require geothermal systems. Using population figures from wikipedia, that gives us a population of about 150 million out of 330m, or 45%, of Americans requiring a geothermal system. </p>
<p><img alt="Energy Intensity Chart from https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19122" src="/heating/market-chart-1.png" /></p>
<p>Combining 45% of 86 million American homes and 90% of 10 million Canadian homes requiring geothermal system gives us a total of about 48 million homes. These are of course estimates, and 50 million homes is probably the upper bound of this market. Nevertheless, these esimates are useful to get a sense of the scale.</p>
<h2 id="revenue-and-profit-potential">Revenue And Profit Potential</h2>
<p>Let us imagine each of these dwellings is outfitted with a geothermal groud loop as described in the <a href="../robot-mole/">Robot Mole</a> article. We estimated that a $2000 group loop installation leaves around $1200 for the amortized cost of developing, producing and renting out the robot moles, which implies a total revenue of $60 billion. At a margin of 10-20%, we're looking $6-10 Billion of profit. As we mentioned, this is an optimistic upper bound based on the total number of dwellings that seem eligible. Nevertheless it strongly imples that even if our estimates are off by an order of magnitude, it still makes a strong case for investing tens of millions of dollars in developing this technology.</p>
<h2 id="worldwide-and-adjacent-markets">Worldwide And Adjacent Markets</h2>
<p>World-wide the opportunity for this technology would not be as great. The vast majority of the world's population lives in much warmer climates where this would not be useful. Much of continental Europe has very mild winters, and the population tends to live in larger apartment complexes powered by different technologies such as District Heating. Overall, I would expect the rest of the world combined (Europe, Russia, Northern Asia) to account for at most the same number of potential installations as North America.</p>
<p>I suspect that this technology is not well-suited to larger buildings where drilling vertically using existing large drilling equipment would make more sense. However, having a smart, flexible miniature tunnel boring technology could find use in adjacent markets such as running cabling, burying electrical lines etc. So while we can reach a reasonable upper-bound on the the revenue we can generate replacing existing fossil fuel heating, there could be more opportunities beyond that.</p>
<h2 id="emissions-saved">Emissions Saved</h2>
<p>Apart from being able to make excellent returns on capital invested, how much emissions could we actually save? It not a trivial thing to answer, as emissions from residential buildings are often mixed with emissions from electricity generation and data is never available for the specific types of dwellings we're considering. </p>
<p>Accoring to <a href="https://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/corporate/statistics/neud/dpa/showTable.cfm?type=HB&amp;sector=aaa&amp;juris=ca&amp;rn=3&amp;page=0">Natural Resources Canada</a>, Canada emitted a total of 515 Megatonnes of CO2 in 2018, of which 43 Megatonnes was solely for residential space heating, which excludes commercial space heating (30Mt) and residential and commercial water heating (15Mt). Overall, we can assume 50Mt of savings annually in Canada, 4x that ammount for the US (as less heating is required and only for less than half the population) and another 2x for the rest of the world, or a grand global total of 500Mt of CO2 equivalent per year. Current global emissions are 36000 Mt per year, so we're looking at savings of around 1.5% of global emissions.</p></div>
