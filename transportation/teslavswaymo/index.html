<h1 id="tesla-vs-waymo-theres-no-competition">Tesla vs Waymo: There's No Competition</h1>
<p><strong>Jan 2022</strong></p>
<p>There have been a lot of articles written and a lot of online debate about the competition between Tesla and Google's off-shoot Waymo in their quest to build a self-driving car. Much of this debate focuses on the specific choices of sensors, LIDAR in the case of Waymo or cameras in the case of Tesla. Most of these debates make for great online fodder, but are irrelevant and misrepresent what's really going on. </p>
<h2 id="the-lesson-from-the-manhattan-project">The lesson from the Manhattan Project</h2>
<p>The Manhattan Project is often cited as a great example of how government successfully developed a world-changing new technology quickly by employing some of the world's smartest people. The Manhattan Project however was not a singular pursuit, but an umbrella for several different programs. The leaders of the project were well aware that while nuclear fission was feasible, there were multiple possible technical implementations and it was impossible to know which one would work. They were dealing with something fundamentally new and unknown, and thus they could not predict what the best solution would look like. Thus the Manhattan Project simultaneously funded and produced two separate, vastly different programs that used completely different supply chains, fuels, inginitions and overall designs.</p>
<p>The self-driving space today is similar in that we're dealing with something fundamentally new that simply does not exist. There is no way to know what a working solution looks like. The different approaches taken by Tesla and Waymo are both valid and it is essential that they both be pursued. In funding both of these approaches, the market has managed to replicate the successful approach of the government-run effort.</p>
<h2 id="tesla-had-no-choice">Tesla had no choice</h2>
<p>A frequent feature of the Tesla/Waymo debates is Elon Musk's deep conviction that only vision is needed, but the truth is that Tesla never had any other option but to try a LIDAR-less approach. Throughout the 2010s Tesla was in a somewhat precarious and cash-strapped position. Meanwhile, Waymo did not have to built actual cars and had access to huge amounts of capital as one of Google's special moonshot projects. They were free to research expensive LIDAR solutions while Tesla had to ship real cars to real customers. Apart from being prohibitively expensive, pursuing LIDAR would probably have been a poor decision for Tesla. By the time their self-driving program got started, Waymo had already spent 5+ years developing a LIDAR-based approach. Starting late, with an identical strategy but fewer resources is a poor decision. It is very likely that Musk's conviction is simply ex-post-facto justification for a choice he never had.</p>
<h2 id="the-technology-will-likely-converge">The technology will likely converge</h2>
<p>The online debates over LIDAR vs Vision also ignore the fact that often mature technology converges on similar solutions. Today, iOS and Android are very similar to each other compared to the early days of smartphones. We can already see the same thing happening in the development of self-driving cars. In 2019, partly as a response to Waymo's heavy dependence on simulations to train their fleet, Elon Musk and Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://leftlanenews.com/tesla/tesla-self-driving-simulation-lidar-give-false-sense-of-progress/">dismissed the value of using simulations</a> in the training of neural networks, saying there was little need for them. Two years later, during Tesla's first AI Day, Tesla's ability to train cars in their simulation was heavily featured as a great advantage.</p>
<p><img alt="Tesla AI Day" src="/transportation/slam.gif" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, the LIDAR vs Vision debate only focuses on one part of the whole tech stach - raw 3D depth perception. Regardless of how a car perceives depth, it still has to make sense of the world and navigate it. That is, the entire debate may easily boil down to whether someone uses a cheap sensor with lots of training, or a more expensive sensor with less training with the end result being a wash.</p>
<h2 id="its-unpredictable">It's unpredictable</h2>
<p>The main takeaway should be that the narrow question of raw depth perception cannot predict who will win or if there will even be a single winner. Throughout the history of technology deployment we can find many examples of first-movers monopolizing and dominating an industry, of second-movers dominating with a more refined market and of multiple companies sharing a market. The outcome of this race will likely be determined by more mundane business decisions like customer service, cleanliness, availability, etc, rather than technical distinctions like which wavelength of photo you process. </p>
<p>The real competition isn't Tesla vs Waymo, but Autonomy vs Non-autonomy, so questions of how precisely self-driving programs can satisfy people's safety concerns and how self-driving cars will fit into society (does an empty car driving around pay for defacto parking?) are much more interesting and relevant.</p></div>
